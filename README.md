# Hamiltonian Tour Visualizer
BFS + cell merging implementation of Hamiltonian Tour for Google Kick Start 2022 Round B
Visualizer for solutions written in Tkinter
Written/upsolved on an airplane cause I was bored lol since I didn't get full marks on contest
I might write the MST + wall implementation too

## to use
run sol.py with some input to generate output to output.txt
run vis.py, which opens output.txt
enter some input in shell to go to next test case
